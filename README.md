## By Ahsan Rasul

The objective of this project is to create a CRUD application using the methods and technologies that encapsulate the core modules covered durint the first 4 weeks of training.

* Trello with a Kanban style board will be used to track initial user stories and tasks needed to complete the app.
* Data will be stored in a relational database hosted on an external cloud service.
* Python will be used to create the app.
* The app will be tested and where possible will use TDD 
* All code will be stored on Github, and work will be done on branches appropriate to the feature being implemented.

### Tech stack

The tech stack to be used has been specified as follows 
* GCP SQL Server and GCP Compute Engine
* Python
* Pytest and Selenium
* HTML
* Git
* Jenkins

### Project Design

As a boardgamer I find it can be difficult to keep track of my collection as well as my friends collections, as such I intend to create an app that will keep track of gamers and will allow me to link their games with them, thus allowing me to see quickly what games a particular person owns. In addition it will have functionality to rate games after they have been played. Finally the ability to remove games from a user as they update their collection will also be added. 

This is the initial ERD for the app.
